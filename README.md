# Chatbot
A versatile application that can conduct an online chat conversation via text-to-speech. Its uses span across various fields, from customer interaction to social network marketing and instant messaging clients.

### Project Setup
1. index.html:

- This is the main HTML file that structures the chatbot interface.
- It includes a title, a chatbox for displaying messages, an input field for user input, and a button to send messages.
- The <link> tag connects the CSS file (styles.css) for styling, and the <script> tag connects the JavaScript file (script.js) for functionality.

2. styles.css:

- This file contains all the CSS styles that define the appearance of the chatbot.
- It styles the body, header, chatbox, user messages, bot messages, input field, and send button.
- The styles ensure that the chatbot is visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. script.js:

- This file contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the chatbot.
- It listens for clicks on the send button and retrieves the user input.
- The addMessage function is responsible for displaying messages in the chatbox, distinguishing between user and bot messages.
- A simulated bot response is generated after a short delay to mimic a real conversation.

### Further Enhancements
- Adding more complex responses, integrating an actual chatbot API, or improving the styling to make it more visually appealing.
- Message timestamps, user authentication, or saving chat history for a more robust application.
